Primertexto=MARACAWA was born under that inspiration,\n                                to see in nature and in the people who work it, an opportunity to link the field with the\n                                city, the land with the activities and tastes of humanity, promoting the quality of all\n                                processes that implies having a product on the table, together with the due recognition of\n                                those who\n                                they make it possible
SegundoTex=MARACAWA recognizes that in the course of a year and a half of consolidating its vision and\n                                objective, the strong link that exists between restaurants and the people who work the field\n                                with their different products, and this does not only include farmers, also involves\n                                professionals from different careers, as social promoters, builders, chefs and kitchen\n                                assistants in the creation of gourmet products, initially to farmers who work a responsible\n                                crop of Jalape\u00f1o and Habanero pepper with the expectation that new products will soon be\n                                harvested.
tercertex=MARACAWA believes that cooking is an art that is given thanks to the existence of excellent\n                                products that lead to good recipes and that can be tasted in the dishes of different\n                                restaurants. He has found in the spicy season a great companion of the meals.
